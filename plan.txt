1. Goals:
    - Move the desk so the sunlight does not shine on the monitor 
    - Remove all clutter
    - Repaint all walls
2. Things that have to be taken
into account:
    - Paint has to be white because we have some leftover
    - Has to be done in 3 days
    - Budget: 100zl
    - Room size: 4mx3m
    - Furniture:
        - Desk
        - 2 sets of drawers
        - Bed
        - Coffee table
3. Task breakdown:
    - Remove all clutter from the drawers (est. time - 30min)
    - Move furniture so you have access to walls (est. time - 1h)
    - Paint all walls white (est. time - 2h)
    - Wait one day for the paint to dry
    - If the old paint does not show through the new paint proceed 
      to the next step, if you can still see the old color then repeat 2 previous steps
    - Move all furniture back where it was except the desk,
      move it to the window wall so morning sunlight does not shine on the monitor

Expected timeline: 2 to 3 days
Expected spendings: 100zl for white paint
